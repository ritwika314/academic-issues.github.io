## Issues in Higher Education System in India

This series of blogs reflect my opinion on some contemporary issues that beset the Higher Education system in India. As a professor in one of the leading 
Technical Institutions in India, I had the opportunity to observe and experience many twists and turns that shaped the Higher Education system in India. Most of 
the policy interventions were brought on by the Ministry of Education or Human Resources. However, govt interventions were supported by a set of educators who 
were close to politicians in power. Technical education by and large apolitical by its inherent characteristics. Yet, the availability of state-of-the-art 
technology spells troubles for political establishment as people may use technology to destabilize established political dispensation. Information flow is a 
major contributor to mass-based upheavals in the Governance of the state. So, the Ministry of Education is crucial for any system of Governance. From time to 
time govt comes up with an intervention to course correct the educators to support those in power. Therefore, it is important to analyze the implications of 
certain policies from a neutral viewpoint.
