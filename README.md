# Academic Issues in Indian Higher Education System

This is a series of blogs which reflects my opinion on some contemporary issues that beset the Higher Education system in India. As a professor in one of the
leading Technical Institutions in India, I had the opportunity to observe and experience many twists and turns that shaped the Higher Education system
in India. Most of the policy intervention were brought on by Ministry of Education or Human Resources. However, govt interventions were supported by a set of
educators who were close to politicians in power. Technical education by and large apolitical by its inherent characteristics. Yet, availability of state of 
the art technology spells troubles for political establishment as people may use technology to destablize established political dispensation. Information flow
is a major contributor to mass based upheavals in governance of state. So, Ministry of Education is very important for any system of Governance. From time to
time govt comes up with intervention to course correct the educators to support those in power. Therefore, it is important to analyze the implications of 
certain policies from a neutral view point.
