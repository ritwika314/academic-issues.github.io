Learning is a continuous process but maturity is slow. Perhaps that the handshaking between needs a bit of external staging. I 
remember a lot of story telling by our primary and middle school teachers. Unfortunately, we did not understand its effectiveness
until it was too late. I believe most of our school teachers were themselves unaware of the fact that the story teling is anything
other than babysitting. The parents also used to think that way. However, panchatantra, mahabharat and ramyan were all time 
favourites with the children. Modern retelling of ramayan from different prospectives are available. However, none of these
can connect to imagination of children as old ramayan stories could do. I tried to narrate ramayan through use of modern gadgets
such as remotes, laser to my daughter couple of times when she was a toddler. Though she liked initially, but soon quikly lost
interest. Ramayan is not just popular in India, but in many parts of the World, such as Indonesia, and Turkey. R. K. Narayan's book
mentions about the popularity ramayan tv serial. It created an interesting business model in entertainment world. People in 
villages pooled money to watch sunday morning serial on rented TVs running with car batteries. There was even a strike of sanitation
workers who demanded that TV serial should be sponsored by the govt. The power of story telling is critical to any tv show or movie entertainment. 

I rember a history teacher in our school. He was not a regular teacher for our class. He used to come when the other regular
teacher was not available.We all were exited when he would amble liesurely into the class. He would tell stories about a 
fictional character he himself created. His character was a detective. I do not know even today, why he thought detective stories
would be interesting to middle school students. But he had sense of story telling art. He made it interesting with use of earthly
phrases and sometime couplets or quotes from well known literature. Today, when I look back I feel like he was exposing the
students to the philosophy of simple living and high thinking. 

We had another history teacher at high school. He used to read a lot, and his classes were a real treat for us. Again I think his
way of presentation without a chalk and board work was outstanding. He taught us dry topics as evolution of constitutional
monarchy in UK, french revolution, american war of independence of world wars I and II with erudition. I believe he did not think anything 
great about moghul reign in India but indulge his students to chanakya and the rule of myurya dynasty. I am not sure if he 
ever thought of writing a history text. However, he was really divasted when we did not perform well in school leaving exams.
I believe the examiners were unable to comprehend some finer details about historical interpretation of the students which
were influenced by our history teacher. But we don't regret the fact that we scored low marks because of his teachings.Most of us
were still indebted for his teachings. In fact, there was unanimous decision to honor him during a class reunion. 
Now I realize that the history syllabus for highschool texts were not only done uimaginatively but were too bland to instil any
learning of the past. I believe memorizing dates and things that the kings did in terms of establish memorials are churlish way
of reperesenting history of a great nation.

Another serious problem in school education is about literature. Language is the building block of expression, presenttion and
communication. Though, the texts and eassys were good, we had horrible teachers.The emphasis was in rot learning. One teacher 
we had would try to recite the poems in nasal singing tone. It was a ordeal for us to sit through his class. I am not sure if
others had similar experience. He also used to threaten us with severe punishment if we did any mischief in the class out of 
boredone. Literature  study should be reoriented to make it more like communcative literature rather than just reciting of 
poems or reading essays.
