## Distruptive Technologies

A disruptive communication technlogy is one that significantly alters the way of communication. In recent years we witnessed 
two disruptive communication systems (i) social networking system and (ii) Instant messaging systems. A few social networking
system we are familiar with are Facebook, LinkedIn, Youtube, and WeChat. Telegram, WhatsApp, Instagram are examples of Instant
messing system. Both communication technologies are excellent innovation to bring world closer. However, the flip side of the 
such disruptive communication has overburdened already stressed lives of ordinary people while app creators are having roaring
business along with network service providers. Meta, Google and Microsoft have already started controlling the govt policies 
world wide. In communication space Ukraine seems to be winning over Russia in the ongoing conflict. Meta has changed its message
posting policies to allow for abuse of Russian Political Dispensation. However, this post is not about Ukraine and Russia conflict. 
The purpose of the post is to evolve a discussion on etiquettes of using disruptive communication.

I remember when disruptive intervention of Arnab Goswami transformed the Times Now TV news. His only motivation was to bring a
change TV transmission of news from passive electronic medium like the Radio or Akashvani.
Mr Goswami became instant bete noire for all news anchors and the people holding leftist views, but TRP of Times Now increased 
tremendously. Mr. Goswami was eventually kicked out of Times Now and Republic TV came into existence. The diruptive news 
transmission is another example of distruptive communication. My intension is not to go into disruptive interventions in the TV
news anchoring. 
The point I want to make is that the disruptive intervenions created a chasm among people in both sides of center. The free
use of profanities jolted people. But eventually all including seasoned political commentators, 
the political parties and groups either developed strong likes or strong dislikes but they could not ignore Mr. Goswami while
he went on meerily creating his TRP and establishing Republic TV. 

Having pointed out the importance of disruptive communication, let us focus on whatsApp or other instant messaging apps. World
over have been dragged into disruptive communication system due to the end device called cell phones and numerous Instant 
messaging apps. There are two sides of any tale. The brighter side is communication have become easy for self employed 
workforce such as a carpenters, plumbers, 
electricians, and small artisans. Business communication has turned instant for the aggregators firms. The consumers find
it easy to communicate with service
providers. However, large bussiness establishment soon learnt to use instant messaging to create disruptive intervention in 
personal privacies. 
I keep getting robot calls during important meetings. It had forced me to leave the phone switched off. People have to learn to 
live incommunicado mode to escape the nuisance of disruptive intervention in personal privacy. Blocking numbers does more harm than 
solving the privacy problems. The blocker apps create database of cell numbers and market them with impunity to advertising firms.
The nexus is frightening. 

However, the most irritations come in the form of trolls and unsolicited knowlede dissemination through Instant messageing
systems. I keep getting rehashed and recirculated whatsApp media files every alternate days. I don't know if whatsApp has a
spam filter or how to turn it on. It is a high time that instant messaging app developers should provide easy ways to 
kill spams. Trolls are big nuisance. A troll can make an average person break within 
a couple of minutes. Usually the unconnected trollers find it tempting to gang together without any reason. It confirms the 
herd mentality of Animal Firm. Sometime, people who don't have 
anything to do with the issue but start commenting. I have to subscribe to a large whatsApp group where 
people seem to have a view on every damn thing from  from toothbrush to broom, Kashmir to Gujrat, from Buddha to Confucius, 
from Chanakya to Machiaevelli. I fondly call them Professors of IWU (International WhatsApp University). But honestly, from the
quality of posts it does not show that the academic excellence of the nation has increased one bit. Rather the profanity in
public discourse has deteroriated. You may get a 1000 messages if you ever say anything like Why sky looks blue today? or "Why PM 
did ot did is silent say 
something on Ukraine Russia conflict?" I don't understand if an average person has anything to do with Ukraine war execept being
harassed due to price inflation. The rampant use of greetings like good morning, good evening, or even "international day of morons" 
makes me wonder if the God has suddenly decided to make everyone happy, and the world has become flat. Yet hatred, spewing
venom on tweeter becomes essential. I guess some "influencers" get paid by groups in look out for trouble. The businesss of
dirts and gossip is just mind bugling. Only one thing that appears in my mind is how much of digital flith actually sell. 
Unmindful of personal privacy people ogle at digital filth and actively participate in make the flith more and more stinking. 
In they expose themselves to privacy invasion. Profling becomes simple due to digital foot prints. AI, ML and Data Science 
gain importance over foundational technologies.
