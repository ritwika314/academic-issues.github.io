##  WhatsApp International University & Distruptive Intervention in Personal Space

Disruptive communication technology significantly alters the way of communication. In recent years we witnessed two 
types of disruptive communication systems (i) social networking systems and (ii) Instant messaging systems. Almost
every reader of this blog must have an account in one social networking site or the other. Examples are Facebook, 
LinkedIn, Youtube, and WeChat. Telegram, WhatsApp, Instagram are examples of Instant messing systems. Both 
communication technologies are excellent innovations to bring the world closer and people to collaborate without
geographical boundaries. The flip side of such disruptive communication has overburdened the already stressed lives of 
ordinary people while app creators, manintainers, promoters are have roaring business along with network service 
providers. Meta, Google, and Microsoft have already started controlling the govt policies worldwide. 
Ukraine seems to be winning over Russia in the ongoing conflict in the e-communication space. Meta has changed its
message posting policies to allow for Russian political dispensation abuse. However, this post is not about Ukraine
and Russia conflict. The purpose of the post is to let the readers think about the etiquettes of using disruptive 
communication channels. I will draw some analogues from mass media mainly e-media. 

I remember when the disruptive intervention of Arnab Goswami transformed the Times Now TV news. His only motivation was 
to create a niche for the news transmission on TV from a passive electronic medium like the Radio or Akashvani. Mr.
Goswami became instant <i>bete noire</i> for all news anchors and the people holding leftist views, but TRP of Times Now 
increased tremendously. Mr. Goswami was eventually kicked out of Times Now, and Republic TV came into existence. The 
disruptive news transmission is another example of disruptive 
communication. I do not intend to go into disruptive interventions in the TV news anchoring. I want to make the point that the 
disruptive interventions created a chasm among people on both sides of the center. The free use of profanities jolted people. But 
eventually, all seasoned political commentators, the political parties, and groups either developed strong likes or strong dislikes. 
However, they could not ignore Mr. Goswami while he merrily created his TRP and established Republic TV. I have witnessed
  increased use of profanities by the politicians and political commentators from the opposition. 

Having pointed out the importance of disruptive communication, let us focus on Whatsapp or other instant messaging apps. World over 
have been dragged into disruptive communication systems due to the end devices (cell phones) and numerous Instant messaging 
apps. There are two sides to any tale. The brighter side is that communication has become easy for the self-employed 
  unorganized workforce such 
as a carpenter, plumbers, electricians, and small artisans. Business communication has turned instant for the 
  aggregators' firms. 
Consumers find it easy to communicate with service providers. However, large business establishments soon learned to use instant 
messaging to create disruptive interventions in personal privacies. I keep getting robot calls during important meetings. It had 
forced me to leave the phone switched off or decline calls. People have to learn to live incommunicado mode to escape the nuisance of disruptive 
intervention in personal space. Blocking numbers does more harm than solving privacy problems. The blocker apps create a database 
of cell numbers and market them with impunity to advertising firms. The nexus is frightening.

However, the most irritations come in trolls and unsolicited knowledge dissemination through Instant messaging systems. I keep 
getting rehashed and recirculated WhatsApp media files every alternate day from unknown sources. I don't know if WhatsApp has a spam filter or turn it 
on. It is high time that instant messaging app developers should provide easy ways to kill spam. Trolls are a big nuisance. A troll 
can make an average person break within a couple of minutes. Usually, the unconnected trollers find it tempting to gang together 
without any reason. It confirms the herd mentality of Animal Firm. Sometimes, people who don't have anything to do with the issue 
start commenting.

I have to subscribe to a large WhatsApp group where people seem to have a view on every damn thing from toothbrush to broom, Kashmir 
to Gujrat, from Buddha to Confucius, from Chanakya to Machiavelli. I fondly call them Professors of WIU (WhatsApp International 
University). But honestly, the quality of posts does not show that the academic excellence of the nation has increased one bit. 
Rather the profanity in public discourse has deteriorated. You may get 1000 messages if you ever say anything like Why sky looks 
blue today? or "Why PM did or did not say something on Ukraine Russia conflict?"

I don't understand if an average person has anything to do with Ukraine war except being hassled by price inflation. The 
rampant use of greetings like good morning, good evening, or even "international day of morons" makes me wonder if God has suddenly 
decided to bestow everyone happy, and the world has become flat with happiness. Yet hatred, spewing venom on tweeter becomes essential. Some 
"influencers" get paid by the groups seeking to create troubles. The business of dirt and gossip is just mind bugling. Only one 
thing that comes to my mind is that "digital flith sells." Unmindful personal privacy, people ogle at the digital filth and actively 
participate in making the flith stink more and more. In they expose themselves to privacy invasion. Profiling becomes simple due to digital 
footprints. AI, ML, and Data Science gain importance over foundational technologies.
