## Distruptive Technologies

A disruptive communication technlogy is one that significantly alters the way of communication. In recent years we witnessed 
two disruptive communication systems (i) social networking system and (ii) Instant messaging systems. A few social networking
system we are familiar with are Facebook, LinkedIn, Youtube, and WeChat. Telegram, WhatsApp, Instagram are examples of Instant
messing system. Both communication technologies are excellent innovation to bring world closer. However, the flip side of the 
such disruptive communication has overburdened already stressed lives of ordinary people while app creators are having roaring
business along with network service providers. Meta, Google and Microsoft have already started controlling the govt policies 
world wide. In communication space Ukrain seems to be winning over Russia in the ongoing conflict. Meta has changed its message
posting policies to allow for abuse of Russian Political Dispensation. However, this post is not about Ukrain and Russia conflict. 
The purpose of the post is to evolve a discussion on etiquettes of using disruptive communication.

I remember when Arnab Goswami transformed the Times Now TV news, his sole aim was to bring a disruption in the news transmission.
Mr Goswami became instant betenoir for the people holding leftist views, but TRP of Times Now increased tremendously. Finally
Mr. Goswami was kicked out of Times Now and Republic TV came into existence. The diruptive new transmission is yet another 
example of distruptive communication. Again my intension is not to go into disruptive interventions in the TV news anchoring. 
However, the point is that the disruptive intervenions created a chasm among people in both sides of center. People including 
the political parties and groups either developed strong likes or strong dislikes but they could not ignore Mr. Goswami.

Having pointed out the importance of disruptive communication, let us focus on whatsApp or other instant messaging app. World
over have been dragged into disruptive communication system due to cell phones and Instant messaging apps. There are two sides
of the tale. The brighter side is communication have become easy for self employed workforce such as a carpenter, plumber, 
electricians, and small artisans. Business communication has turned instant. Consumers find it easy to communicate with service
providers. However, large bussiness establishment use instant messaging to create disruptive intervention in personal privacies. 
I keep getting robot calls during important meeting. It had forced me to leave the phone switched off. People have to turn 
incommunicado mode to escape the nuisance of disruptive intervention in personal privacy. Blocking numbers does more harm to 
privacy than it solving the problem. Blocker apps create database of cell numbers and market them to advertising firms. The
nexus is frightening. 

However, the most irritation comes in the form of trolls and unsolicited knowlede dissemination. I keep getting rehashed or 
recirculated whatsApp media files every alternate days. I don't know if whatsApp has a spam filter. It is a high time that 
instant messaging app developers should provide one. Trolls are big nuisance. A troll can make an average person break within 
a couple of hours. Usually trollers gang together without any reason. I have to subscribe to a large whatsApp group where 
people seem to have a view on every damn thing from Kashmir to Gujrat, from toothbrush to broom, from Buddha to Confucious, 
from Chanakya to Machievelle. I fondly call them WIU Profs (WhatsApp Internation University Professors). But honestly from the
quality of posts it does not show that the academic excellence of the nation has increased a bit. Rather the profanity of 
public discourse has deteroriated. You may get a 100 messages if you ever say anything like why PM Modi is silent or said
something on Ukrain Russia conflict. The rampant use of greetings like good morning, good evening, this or that happy day 
makes me wonder if the God has suddenly decided to make everyone happy. Only one thing that appears in my mind is how much of
digital flith that the people world over have created. Profiling a person becomes easy if any data mining company looks 
carefully into the profanity of whatsApp message.
