## Institutes of Eminence in India

I recommend the blog readers to go through the Wikipedia article on IoE. It gives a detailed report on IoE scheme of the UGC including the background history and 
the glimpse of politicization of the Higher Education in the country. In 2018 the UGC announced the list of IoE, it included the name of a University (Jio 
University) which did not exist. I believe most blog readers like me may still be bewildered whether the university has started functioning even today. One report 
I saw tells the university is coming up on a plot of 52-acres in the Navi Mumbai area of Maharashtra and is supposed to start functioning from 2021. Jio 
University is planning to focus on AI, Data Science. Reliance is predominantly active in Petroleum, Telecom, and Retailing. The focus appears to ensure immediate 
cash flow for the university operations rather than building a skill-based world class university. Most of the CSR funds from Reliance may probably flow into Jio 
University. 

Though most educators like me and the public were obsessed with Jio IoE, many did not know that  privately funded institutes that received IoE tags or letters of 
intent are promoted by doubtful operators. How can someone convince the general public that some XYZ private funded university in India is better than IIT Kanpur? 
What parameters are used to determine the selection? Forget about privately funded universities; even the public institutions such as JU, UoH, or DU are yet to be 
at par with IIT Kanpur.  It only indicates either IIT Kanpur has been a sloppy applicant or the people in charge of IoE application filing at IIT Kanpur did 
something to ruffle feathers of the UGC mandarins.  

Now let us dwell a bit on the process of IoE selection. Some less-informed readers may not know that INR 75 lacs (just a little less than 100000 USD) was charged 
as an application fee for the IoE tag. Out of which 20% is the cost of the IoE tag, and 80% is to be returned to successful applicants. Suppose an institution's 
application is unsuccessful. it loses 100% of the application fee. Initially, the UGC provisioned that if a public-funded institution gets an IoE tag, it will 
automatically be qualified for a slew of fund injections by govt. The privately funded IoEs get autonomy from the UGC and can be decided on their curricula. I am 
not sure how much of that intent is in practice. India's regulatory bodies are either infested with bureaucrats or bureaucrat-friendly experts who are power-
hungry sarks. It isn't easy to believe that the IoEs are genuinely autonomous. 

Another less known part of IoE implementation policy is to return 80% of the application money to successful IoEs. I don't know if  the UGC is yet to return the 
money even after three years. Whether it is another example of sloppy bureaucratic operation or deliberate withholding of the amount is a question we must ponder.
