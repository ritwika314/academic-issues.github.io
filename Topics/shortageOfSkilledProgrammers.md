## Shortage of Skilled Programmers

Around 1987 India launched an Atmanirvar Project (National Initiative) for building supper computers because of US sanction against import of Cray-XMP.
CDAC was established in August 1988 and created a flutter in technology landscape of India by announcing PARAM. At round the same time, three other govt 
research labs, NAL-Bangalore, BARC with DRDO Hyderabad and CSIR with C-DOT were building High Performance Parallel Computers.  
I finished my Ph. D. in 1985 with specialization in Design of Parallel Algorithms. I could publish a few research papers. I did not know how could I 
contribute to HPC research in India. Only way things worked in job market was to get hold of a copy of employment samachar or scan news papers for 
advertisements regarding employments. I soon became disillusioned about how people manage to get jobs. I started trying my luck with bank probationary 
officers. I qualified the written test on a couple of instances. However, when the interview board came to know that I hold a Ph. D. degree they politely 
rejected me saying that I am over qualified and should seek a professor's position at some institutions. Finally, I got a job on first attempt as a lecturer
in one of highly regarded institution of national importance. 

As a professor of an institute of national importance, I became an expert overnight and attended couple of meetings of DST where I came to know about 
PARAM, Anupam, Anurag, Flosolvers. I was particularly impressed by NAL's one man show. However, bureaucrat scientists of India were not impressed. They 
wanted Cray machines. They were apprehensive about trying out new concept of thinking parallely for programming. Naturally, all the efforts of Atmanirvar
Bharat quickly transformed to US nirvar Bharat. On one occasion I was challenged for trained parallel programmer by one scientist of an agency. I retorted
back and accepted his challenge. But he never sent any trainees to us. So the challenge ended in a damp squib. 

The art of programming and programming tools have undergone a sea of change from 1990s. Now multicore and manycore machines are available every where. Even
quad-core and eight-core laptops are available for personal use. So, HPC research has changed to automatic parallelization. A new startup called Bodo.ai
is offering auto-parallelization tools for Python programs that can run 1000 time faster.
