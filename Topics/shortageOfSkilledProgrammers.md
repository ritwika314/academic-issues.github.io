## Shortage of Skilled Programmers

Around 1987 India launched an Atmanirvar Project (National Initiative) for building supper computers because of US sanction against import of Cray-XMP.
CDAC was established in August 1988 and created a flutter in technology landscape of India by announcing PARAM. At round the same time, three other govt 
research labs, NAL-Bangalore, BARC with DRDO Hyderabad and CSIR with C-DOT were building High Performance Parallel Computers.  

I finished my Ph. D. in 1985 with specialization in Design of Parallel Algorithms. I was lucky to get a few research papers published in reputed
professional journal. But, I did not know how could I contribute to HPC research in India. Only way things worked in job market in those days was to get 
hold of a copy of rozgar samachar (english version was employment news) or scan well known news papers like ToI/Statesman/Hindu/IE for 
advertisements regarding employments. I soon became disillusioned and wondered how people could manage to get jobs. 
I started trying my luck with bank probationary 
officers. I qualified the written test on a couple of instances. However, when the interview board came to know that I hold a Ph. D. degree they politely 
rejected me saying that I am over qualified and should seek a professor's position at some institutions. Finally, I got a job on first attempt as a lecturer
in one of highly regarded institution of national importance. 

As a professor of an institute of national importance, I became an expert overnight and attended couple of meetings of DST where I came to know about 
PARAM, Anupam, Anurag, Flosolvers. I was particularly impressed by NAL's one man show. However, bureaucrat scientists of India were not impressed. They 
wanted Cray machines. I believe, they were apprehensive for two reasons:
<ul>
  <li>They did not have faith on homegrown technology which ultimately relied on imported components, and</li>
  <li>They did not have any training on design of parallel algorithms or MPI</li>
  </ul> 
Naturally, all the efforts of Atmanirvar Bharat quickly transformed to US nirvar Bharat. There were also outside experts from other highly acclaimed institutions
of national importance, who favoured the thinking of agencies. On one occasion I was challenged for trained parallel programmer by one scientist of an agency. 
I accepted his challenge and asked him to send his programmer for an upskill training. But he never sent any trainees to us. So, my participation to India's
HPC-cum parallel computing ended prematurely. 

The art of programming and programming tools have undergone a sea of change from 1990s. Now even multicore laptops. Using AWS and Kubernets it is possible to
acquire clusters programming on the cloud. Companies like Bodo (http://bodo.ai/) offers tools for automatic parallelization of Python programs. Bodo collobration
with Xlinx brings simplicity of Python to large scale media processing. So with simplicity of native Python coding it provides a new approach to HPC style
parallel programming. The idea ultimately leads us to having a bunch of intelligent people trained in classical programming skills. Graduates from a good school 
could very easily fit into the job. Unfortunately, the training is lacking. A root cause analysis will point to the fact that the educators don't have the skill
to train. A skilled person from an average school is mostly self taught. What are the options left?
