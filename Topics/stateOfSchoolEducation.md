## State of Primary and Middle Education in India

Jharkhand is carved mainly from Santhan Parganas and Chhotnagpur divisions of the then southern Bihar. 
It came into existence on November 15, 2000 which happens to be the birth anniversary of the tribal leader Birsa Munda. Birsa
Munda was a tribal freedom fighter and religious movement leader of late 19th century. Ranchi Airport is named after Birsa
Munda. For more details about Birsa Munda the readers may refer to the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birsa_Munda)
Recently, during a random browsing of youtube channels I came across a video on the state of primary and middle school
education in Jharkhand. I don't remember the geographic location of the place or the name of school on which the video
was made. However, it gives a telling commentary on the state of the primary and the middle school education in the state.
The anchor presented the video in a local dialect of Hindi which was difficult to comprehend in every details. However, the 
way he presented the video leaves no doubt about the message he wanted to convey. 

Let me first dwell a bit on the video before focusing on the issues that the anchor wanted to bring out.  The video was shot
in a govt run middle school. The total enrollment according to the school coordinator is about 450. The school employs
four teachers against a sanctioned strength of eight. About 120 students are registered for class 8, but the class room can 
hold just about 60 students. According to the class teacher, not more than 40-45 students attend the the school in any day.The 
building and infrastructure are in absymal state.  Though the infrastructure is a problem and building is too
cluttered for a decent school. Both daylight and ventilation are poor in the class room.  However, infrastructure and building
are more of a resource problem that can possibly be solved with a bit of good samaritan act by the state ministery of education.
The bigger problem is the way that kids are being trained. Out of 45 odd students only one can successfully name the subjects in 
the syllabus for class 8. When asked about maths one student told the anchor that he can do up to 30. The anchor assumed
that the student has memorized tables for numbers up to 30. The anchor wanted to double check and asked the student to recite 
the table of 5. Then the student clarified he could only count up to 30!! No student was able to correctly spell the names of 
months in a calendar. The teacher after erasing the month name three times wrote February incorrectly. He was corrected by
one of the smarter kids in the class who incidentally could spell the word "science" correctly both in English and in Hindi. 

The purpose of giving a short description of video is not to denigrate the school possibly in Palamau district, but to understad 
the issues in management of school education and apathy of the state govt to create a vibrant base for the higher and technical 
education in the state of Jharkhand. I believe most govt run schools are in similar state perhaps across the states specially
located in villages and small semi-urban settlements in India. The basic issues that the video brings out are as follows:
- The teachers are unfit, there is hardly any knowledge gap between the teacher and the taught. 
- The education seems to be the last welfare priority for the party in power.
- The govt spending in education is non-existent or extremely low.
- The social awareness for education sector is also very low among people in general specially in underdeveloped states. 
- The political parties in general are either apathetic or scared to empower people by educating them.
- The political parties depend only giving out freebies for winning election and capturing power.

Recently, GOI appointed a new chairpersoon of UGC.
