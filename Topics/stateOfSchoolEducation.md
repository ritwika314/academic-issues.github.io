## State of Primary and Middle Education in India

Jharkhand is carved out of southern part of Bihar mainly Santhan Parganas and Chotnagpur divisions. 
It came into existence on November 15, 2000 which happens to be the birth anniversary of tribal leader Birsa Munda. Birsa
Munda was a tribal freedom fighter and religious movement leader of late 19th century. Ranchi Airport is named after Birsa
Munda. For more details about Birsa Munda please refer to the relevant [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birsa_Munda)
Recently, during a random browsing of youtube channels I came across a video on state of primary and middle school
education in Jharkhand. I have no idea of the geographic location of the place or the name of school on which the video
was made. However, it gives a telling commentary on the state of primary and middle school education in the country.
The anchor presented the video in a dialect of Hindi which was difficult to comprehend in every details. However, the 
way he presented the video leaves no doubt about the message he wanted to convey. 

Let me first dwell a bit on the video before focusing on the issue his video brings out. It is a govt run middle
school where about 450 students are enrolled. It have four teachers. About 120 students are enrolled for class 8. The 
building and infrastructure are in absymal state. The class room can hold just about 60 students. Apparently, not 
more than 40-45 students attend the the school every day. Infrastructure is certainly a problem and building is too
cluttered for a decent school. However, infrastructure and building are more of a resource problem that can possibly be
solved with a bit of good samaritan act by the state ministery of education. The bigger problem is the way that kids are
being trained. Out of 45 odd students only one can successfully name the subjects in the syllabus. When asked about 
maths one student told the anchor that he can count up to 30!! No student was able to correctly write the names of 
months in a calendar. The teacher after erasing month name three times wrote February incorrectly. He was corrected by
the smartest kid in the class who could spell science correctly. 

The purpose of giving a short description of video is not to denigrate the school but to understad the issues in 
management of school education and apathy of state govt to create a vibrant base for higher and technical education in
Jharkhand. I believe most govt run schools are in similar state all
