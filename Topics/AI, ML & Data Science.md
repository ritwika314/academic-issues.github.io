I have been trying gathering info about how many CS students are pursuing PhDs in ML, AI and Data Science at IISc and IITs?  It appears from a [recent post
on LinkedIn by Prof Smruti Sarangi](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/smruti-sarangi-1120286_how-a-false-love-for-aiml-is-destroying-ugcPost-6890555621486292992-Oc0r) of IIT Delhi that at least 80% are doing so. At one point of time most PhDs in Soft Computing were from ISI Kolkata.  
If I am not mistaken, very few ISI graduates feature in CS faculty at IITs or IISc. One my colleagues once remarked ISI Ph. Ds are good at research and publishing
papers but are too unidimensional for engineering faculty material. I don't know if he will revise his opinion about the recent stream of Ph. Ds from IITs. 
I fully concur with Prof Sarangi's observation that out of 500 odd candidates we have interviewed in various selection committees even 5% have basic 
understanding of programming. In fact, it reminds of a selection committee where one professor from a reputed cental institute dared to ask the student to write
print hello program in C. I was ashtonished and asked her in inaudible voice: "Are you serious?". She was very confident, and replied back in equally inaudible
voice: "Just wait and see".  One other independent panel member (I believe a Prof in mechanincal engieering from IITB) was curiously witnessing our exchanges.
The candidate did not have any clue of C programming though he claimed to have written programs in C for his dissertation. After the candidate went out, the panel 
member from IITB told me that he knew that the lady panelist would be right. Now it seems IITs and IISc have joined the stream. As Prof Sarangi says it probably
signals the end of innovations that the CS graduates were spearheading in India until now.  

Forget network, database, computer architecture, or OS, the candidates cannot even answer fundamentals like DS, Algorithms, and Discrete Structures. Data
Science is another dampner. As one commented data scientists are "Stasticians masquareding as computer programmers" or "Programmers masquerading as 
stasticians". Some comments on Prof Sarangi's post may be valid on surface. One guy from some industry (possibly quite excited about gaming and 
entertainment business) comments that AI and ML provide higher order of abstractions which can aid in more complex problem solving. He cites the complexity of
ray tracing in discovering gaming alternatives which AI easily do. He also goes on to say that mechaninical engieers, biologists need not understand intricacies 
of neural networks to solve their problems. But the question that remains is how does the mechnical engineer or the biologist even know that the problem is solved
correctly? If none of them are trained in their core competence then the ability to even judge a solution would not exist. Possibly, no one has been able to
get to the bottom of the main theme of Prof Sarangi's post except for a few. It is high time we wake up to the divastation that AI and ML can do to core 
engineering disciplines.  

It is unfortunate craze promoted by industry honcos to create fissures in foundations of engineering education. I am not sure if industries are only driven by 
short term gains or see AI, ML and Data Science can really propel industry 4.0.
